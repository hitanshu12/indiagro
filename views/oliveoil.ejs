								<h2>WELCOME TO INDIAGRO</h2>
								<p>

									have very hign nutritive value since its discovery about 5,000 years ago.

									mediterranean basin. Oilve oil is closer in chemical structure to the skin's 
									natural oil than any other naturally occurring oil.

								<h2>Extra Virgin Olive Oil</h2>
								<p>
									Extra Virgin Olive Oil is the highest-grade olive oil with excellent aroma and 
									flavour. Extra virgin oil results from the first cold pressing of the olive fruit
									 within 24 hours of harvesting. It is comparatively heavy and viscous and thus 
									 ideal for dressing, flavourings and condiments. Its main culinary application is 
									 for cold dishes: to dress salads, pasta, rice, vegetables, meat and fish. Also use 
									 it as a healthy butter substitute on your toast or roti!
									<br/>	<br/>
									Late studies show that the EV oil is a better element for the prevention of heart 
									disease. The olive oil also is used in a very natural way and not as a pharmaceutical 
									product. Since the 80s, studies about the poly-unsaturated omega 3 and omega 6 fatty 
									acids, coming from fish oils in reference with the heart disease and mainly 
									arteriosclerosis.

									etc. Solas Olive Pomace Oil is a healthy substitute for the oils mainly used presently by the 
									Indian consumer, i.e. sunflower, safflower, corn, soya, palm, etc. Its neutral flavour &amp; 
									high smoking point makes it ideal for Indian cooking. Though recommended to use completly it can 
									also be used in 1/3 rd the qty of other oils while cooking
									<br/><br/>
									Solas Olive pomace oil contains higest monosaturated good fats amongst edible oils &amp; very low 
									saturated bad fats which are associated with numerious health benefits.

									olives, there is still some oil residue left that can be extracted from olive pomace. Olive pomace 
									oil is good for high heat cooking
